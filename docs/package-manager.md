# Package Manager Comparison for Cardano Development

This document compares different package managers for use in Cardano development projects.

## npm vs yarn vs pnpm

| Feature | npm | yarn | pnpm |
|---------|-----|------|------|
| **Installation Speed** | Slowest | Fast | Fastest |
| **Disk Space Usage** | Highest | Medium | Lowest |
| **Monorepo Support** | Workspaces | Workspaces | Workspaces (best implementation) |
| **Dependency Resolution** | Nested | Flattened | Content-addressable |
| **Phantom Dependencies** | Allows | Allows | Prevents |
| **CI Integration** | Easiest | Easy | Easy |
| **Ecosystem Compatibility** | Best | Very Good | Good (improving) |
| **Security Features** | Basic | Better | Best |

## Why pnpm for Cardano Development?

1. **Performance**: Cardano development involves large dependencies. pnpm's speed significantly improves developer experience.

2. **Disk Efficiency**: When working with blockchain nodes that already require substantial storage, saving space with pnpm's shared dependencies is beneficial.

3. **Deterministic Builds**: Critical for smart contract development where exact dependency versions affect security.

4. **Phantom Dependencies Prevention**: pnpm strictly enforces declared dependencies, preventing subtle bugs.

5. **Node Version Management**: Built-in support for managing Node.js versions without additional tools.

## Migration

To migrate from npm to pnpm, run:

```bash
./migrate-to-pnpm.sh
```

## Additional Tools for Cardano Development

When working with Cardano, consider these additional tools:

- **cardano-cli**: Essential command-line interface for Cardano blockchain interaction
- **cardano-node**: Core node implementation
- **Aiken**: Domain-specific language for Cardano smart contracts
- **Ogmios**: WebSocket client to interact with Cardano nodes
- **Lucid**: Cardano transaction library for JavaScript/TypeScript

All these tools work well with pnpm-managed projects.
