# Migration to pnpm: Status Report

## Completed Tasks

1. **Package.json Updates**:

   - Fixed script commands to work with pnpm
   - Updated dependency versions:
     - Changed `@types/cbor` from `^9.0.0` to `^6.0.4`
     - Updated `@cardano-ogmios/client` from `^5.7.0` to `^6.11.2`

2. **Configuration Files**:

   - Verified `.npmrc` configuration with proper settings
   - Verified `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for monorepo support
   - Updated VS Code tasks to use pnpm commands
   - Updated Jest configuration for better test execution

3. **Workflow Updates**:

   - GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow updated to use pnpm
   - Added proper caching for pnpm store

4. **Build Verification**:

   - Created test build file to verify TypeScript compilation
   - Fixed Jest test execution and verified tests are passing

5. **Documentation**:
   - Updated README.md with pnpm installation and usage instructions
   - Added note about pnpm being the preferred package manager

## Current Status

- **Package Management**: Successfully migrated from npm to pnpm
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies resolved and installed correctly
- **Build Process**: TypeScript compilation working correctly
- **Testing**: Jest tests running and passing
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow updated for pnpm
- **Docker**: Docker/Docker Compose already configured for pnpm

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:

   - Add more comprehensive tests for smart contract validation
   - Consider adding integration tests for Cardano node connectivity

2. **Cardano Node Integration**:

   - Test the Cardano node integration with updated dependencies
   - Verify compatibility with `@cardano-ogmios/client` v6.11.2
   - Update any code that might be incompatible with the new version

3. **MCP SDK Implementation**:

   - Consider replacing the mock MCP SDK with the actual implementation
   - Test with a real Model Context Protocol client

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Add proper logging for the server
   - Implement health checks for the Cardano node connection

## Noted Issues

- The mock MCP SDK implementation is currently being used instead of the actual SDK
- Cardano node connectivity needs to be verified with the updated dependencies
- Update VS Code launches configurations to use pnpm if needed
