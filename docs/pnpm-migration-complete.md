# Migration to pnpm Completion Report

## Migration Status: âœ… COMPLETE

The migration from npm to pnpm has been successfully completed. All necessary changes have been implemented and the project is now fully functional using pnpm as the package manager.

## Changes Made

1. **Package Management**:

   - Installed pnpm globally
   - Created proper pnpm configuration files (.npmrc)
   - Generated pnpm-lock.yaml file
   - Updated dependency versions for compatibility

2. **Configuration Updates**:

   - Updated VS Code tasks.json to use pnpm commands
   - Fixed Jest configuration for proper test execution with pnpm
   - Updated package.json scripts for pnpm compatibility

3. **Documentation**:

   - Updated README.md with pnpm installation and usage instructions
   - Created pnpm-migration-status.md documentation
   - Added this completion report

4. **Verification**:
   - Successfully built the project with pnpm
   - Verified that TypeScript compilation works
   - Confirmed that tests run and pass with pnpm
   - Validated Docker configuration compatibility

## Benefits of Using pnpm

1. **Disk Space Efficiency**: pnpm uses a content-addressable store which saves disk space by avoiding duplication of dependencies.

2. **Faster Installation**: pnpm is often faster than npm, especially on large projects or in CI environments.

3. **Strict Dependency Resolution**: pnpm creates a non-flat node_modules structure that prevents access to undeclared dependencies.

4. **Monorepo Support**: pnpm has native support for monorepos through workspaces, making it easier to manage multiple packages.

5. **Deterministic Installations**: pnpm ensures that the same dependencies are installed in the same way across all environments.

## Next Steps

While the migration to pnpm is complete, here are recommendations for future improvements:

1. **Cardano Node Integration Testing**: Test the integration with the Cardano node and Ogmios using the updated dependencies.

2. **MCP SDK Implementation**: Replace the mock MCP SDK with the actual implementation and test functionality.

3. **Expanded Test Coverage**: Add more comprehensive tests, including integration tests.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement improved monitoring and logging for better observability.

The project is now ready for further development using pnpm as the package manager, following modern JavaScript project best practices.
